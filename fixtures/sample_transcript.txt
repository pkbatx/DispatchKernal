Agent Alex: Sorry to hear that. Is anyone currently impacted?
Caller Jordan: Yes, production customers are seeing intermittent failures and the incident is already posted to the status page.
Agent Alex: Understood. Any recent changes?
Caller Jordan: We deployed a config change to the payment gateway last night. Rolling back now seems to stabilize things.
Agent Alex: Great. We'll keep monitoring. Anything else you need?
